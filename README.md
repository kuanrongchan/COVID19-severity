# Introduction
This database is a curation of 6 transcriptomics datasets comparing the gene expression in severe COVID-19 and mild COVID-19 subjects. Each database contains raw count data and a processed file, where the raw count data may be visualised with the box and strip plots in the app. The processed files contain p-value (t-test), adjusted p-value (BH step-up procedure), ratio, and fold-change data between severe COVID-19 and mild COVID-19, or severe COVID-19 and healthy subjects. The data may be found in the counts and anova folders respectively.

The publication for this database can be found at [link] ().

# Getting Started
To use the app:
1. Select a database to query
2. Search for your gene of interest using the filtered indicated in the dataframe headers.
3. Tick the checkbox next to the gene of interest. Note that only one gene can be selected at a time for graph plotting.
4. Box and strip plots of the selected gene of interest in the dataset will be plotted. Mouse over the various plots for more in-depth statistics of each group.
